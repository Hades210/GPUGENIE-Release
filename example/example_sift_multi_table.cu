	/*** NOTE TO DEVELOPERS ***/
	/*
	 The library is still under development. Therefore there might be crashes if
	 the parameters are not set optimally.

	 Optimal settings may help you launch ten times more queries than naive setting,
	 but reducing hash table size may result in unexpected crashes or insufficient
	 topk results. (How can you expect 100 topk results from a hash table of size 50
	 or a threshold of 100 suppose you only have 128 dimensions?) So please be careful
	 if you decide to use non-default settings.

	 The basic & must-have settings are:
	 1. dim
	 2. num_of_topk
	 3. data_points
	 4. query_points
	 And leave the rest to default.

	 Recommended settings:
	 If you want to increase the query selectivity (default is one bucket itself, i.e. radius 0,
	 which is absolutely not enough), you can use either way as follows:
	 A. set radius to a larger value, e.g. 1, 2, 3 and so on. It will expand your search
	 	 upwards and downward by the amount of buckets you set. However, it does not guarantee
	 	 the selectivity since data distribution may not even.
	 B. set the selectivity and turn on use_adaptive_range, e.g. selectivity = 0.01 and
	 	 use_adaptive_range = true. It can guarantee that on each dimension the query will match
	 	 for at least (selectivity * data size) number of data points.
	 Note that approach B will overwrite approach A if both are set.

	 Advanced settings:
	 For num_of_hot_dims and hot_dim_threshold, please contact the author for details.
